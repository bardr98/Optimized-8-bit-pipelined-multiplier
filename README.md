# Optimized-8-bit-pipelined-multiplier
This code demonstrates a pipelined multiplier design, which leverages parallelism to achieve high performance. It utilizes a four-stage pipeline to compute the product of two 8-bit numbers (a and b). The multiplier is designed to be efficient and optimized for speed.
